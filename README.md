# 🎉 emdca - Build Efficient AI-Driven Systems

## 🛠️ Overview

emdca is a set of guidelines for building robust software using Python. It combines several design principles and patterns such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Vertical Slices. By using these principles, you can create systems that are reliable, clean, and easy to maintain. This is especially important for artificial intelligence applications where errors can have significant consequences.
